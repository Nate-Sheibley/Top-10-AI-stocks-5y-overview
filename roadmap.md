# Scope

Top 10 AI companies

2021 May - 2024 May

Top 10 AI stocks in kaggle dataset.

Trends to analyse: cumReturns, daylieReturns, Volitility, Correlation to stock indicies

# Questions and graphs
Questions
* TODO

Graphs:
  * Correlation to stock indicies w/ regression lines
  * A sampling of timer series (current, before boom, durring boom)
  * cumReturn graphs, w/ regression lines (yearly)
  * Correlation heatmap for AI stocks to see if all are similar
 
  * Comparison of individual AI companies  
  * graph of total trade price for each company and compare ratios (stacked bar? scatter?)

# Due Date Mon, June 17th

# Plan: Agendas and Action items

## Meeting 2 Agenda
AA: Find API for stock indicies (Dow Jones and S&P500)

Response: If can not find API by EOD Shift to 2 years of data and use polygon API. Target, complete current 2 years of analysis, if time, and API anllows expand backways in 2y increments


AA: Scope of stock metric APIs: 

Response: cumReturns, daylieReturns, Volitility, Correlation to stock indicies, avg topAI stock price

AA: Decide graphs

Response: 
  * Correlation to stock indicies w/ regression lines
  * A sampling of timer series (current, before boom, durring boom)
  * cumReturn graphs, w/ regression lines (yearly)
  * plot avg AIcumReturn to see if any have outlier performances
  * Comparison of individual AI companies  
  * graph of total trade price for each company and compare ratios (stacked bar? scatter?)
  * Correlation heatmap for AI stocks to see if all are similar

## Meeting 1 Agenda

Decide exact data/scope

Finish roadmap outline, write day-tasks

Get API keys

Make API calls

clean data. Come back with good data monday

### TODO - sort into tasks/scope as appropriate

* Share of AI companies in fortune 500

* Combine with fortune 500 or other indicator stock for general comparison

* identify avg prices changes per stock/index. compare vs avg ai trend (all companies). find outliers

* Look at stock evaluation metrics/indicators.
Dataset includes trading volume.

* Combine daylie data to weekly or monthly and average
Use  we want.

### Questions: 

does AI stock outcompete common investments.

Identify trend of SP500, treasury bonds, other indicator stocks, and AI companies since AI boom 
Use unemployment or other proxies for economy health?

AI boom when? Baseline by going back a few years from then

Were these stocks more resilient in economic turmoil (2020)

Were there outliers within AI companies

When would AI have been the best investment. Is it still?

PREDICTIONS

### Advise from instructors:

[Proposal presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18OrJYFomjt88RlA2M-8i7M9ukaBOeqgP/edit#slide=id.p1)
 
market data api - there's a whole bunch. Check free tiers

api market

marksetstack - 1y history

6-8 graphs for the whole project

what metrics. performance? volatility? correlations?  pick sub ranges

focus on most current data primary.

take a sample of the years? 1 year current. 1 year before boom. a sample of other years tbd.
